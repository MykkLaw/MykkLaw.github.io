    <p id="Para1"><i>Hi!</i> My name is Mykalah, and I am currently a high school senior aspiring towards my Master's in Occupational Therapy. I was born in Miami, Florida, but my family is Jamaican. Before I graduate high school, I will have completed by AA degree at Miami Dade College North Campus. This is because of the high school I attend, SAS North, in which I am enrolled as a full-time college student. </p>
